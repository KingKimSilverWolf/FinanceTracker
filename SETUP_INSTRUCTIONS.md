# DuoFi - Setup Instructions

## 🎉 Phase 1 - Foundation Setup In Progress!

### Current Status:
✅ Next.js 14 initialized with TypeScript
✅ Tailwind CSS configured
✅ ESLint set up
✅ Project renamed to `duofi`

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Reopen VS Code

The workspace has moved from `FinanceTracker` to `duofi`. Please:

1. **Close VS Code completely**
2. **Reopen VS Code in the new directory:**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/kimmagidhi/Desktop/duofi
   code .
   ```
3. **Or use:** File → Open Folder → Select `/Users/kimmagidhi/Desktop/duofi`

### Next Steps (I'll handle these):
