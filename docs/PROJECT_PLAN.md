## 📋 Project Overview

### Vision
A modern, intuitive web application for groups of 2 or more people to track shared and individual finances with beautiful visualizations, seamless mobile experience, and automated settlement calculations.

### Core Problem Statement
**Current spreadsheet-based tracking (like the provided example) has major pain points:**
- Confusing and hard to navigate on mobile
- Lacks visual clarity and modern UX
- Manual formula management is error-prone
- Difficult to see "who owes whom" at a glance
- No automated calculations or alerts
- Poor mobile experience for quick expense entry
- Hard to track historical trends and patterns
- Settlement calculations require manual tracking

### Real-World Use Case (Origin Story)
This app was born from a real Google Sheets used by Kim & Ray to track their shared living expenses:
- **Shared expenses:** Rent, utilities (gas, water, internet), parking, furniture
- **Split tracking:** Full price + individual contributions for each person
- **Grocery system:** Monthly tracking of who bought groceries, settlement at month end
- **Settlement calculation:** Automated "To Pay Kim" or "To Pay Ray" amounts
- **Utility details:** Month-by-month breakdown with yearly totals

### Target Users
- **Couples living together** - Primary use case (roommates, partners, married couples)
- **Roommates** - 2-4+ people sharing rent and bills
- **Friends** - Group trips, shared subscriptions, events
- **Family members** - Adult children with parents, siblings sharing costs
- **Small groups** - Any 2+ people with recurring shared expenses
- **Individuals** - Can also use for personal finance tracking only

## 📊 Current Spreadsheet Analysis (What We're Replacing)

### Spreadsheet Structure (Kim & Ray's Real Example):
```
Section 1: Monthly Shared Expenses
├── Rent: $2,879.74 (Kim: $1,498.20 | Ray: $1,381.55)
├── Gas: $25.50 (Kim: $0.00 | Ray: $25.50)
├── Water: $91.15 (Kim: $0.00 | Ray: $91.15)
├── Internet: $0.00 (Kim: $0.00 | Ray: $0.00)
├── Parking: $125.00 (Kim: $0.00 | Ray: $125.00)
├── Furniture: $150.00 (Kim: $150.00 | Ray: $0.00)
├── Total: $3,271.39
└── Settlement: "To Pay Kim: $1,306.55"

Section 2: Groceries Monthly Tracking
├── Responsible person tracked (Kim/Ray)
├── Monthly contributions
├── Settlement calculations
└── Running totals per person

Section 3: Utility Details (Gas & Water)
├── Month-by-month breakdown
├── Individual contributions per month
├── Yearly totals
└── Notes (e.g., "paid twice because of error")
```

### Key Insights from Spreadsheet:
1. **Full price is tracked** - Then split between people
2. **Not always 50/50** - Custom amounts per person per expense
3. **Settlement is calculated** - Shows exactly who owes whom
4. **Multiple views** - Summary + detailed breakdowns
5. **Yearly tracking** - Monthly data aggregates to yearly totals
6. **Notes/Comments** - Important for context (errors, special cases)
7. **Category-based** - Expenses grouped by type

### Pain Points to Solve:
❌ Hard to navigate on mobile
❌ Manual formula management
❌ No visual charts or trends
❌ Difficult to quickly add expenses on-the-go
❌ No automated alerts or reminders
❌ Settlement calculation requires scrolling
❌ Historical comparison is tedious
❌ No receipt storage or photos
❌ Formatting breaks easily
❌ Sharing/collaboration can cause conflicts

- **`categories`** - System & custom categories

**Key Changes from Old Schema:**
1. ✅ `groups` replaces `couples` - no more `partner1Id`/`partner2Id` limitation
2. ✅ `groupMembers` junction table - users can be in multiple groups
3. ✅ Flexible `splitData` object - works for any number of people
4. ✅ Amount stored in cents - avoid floating-point issues
5. ✅ Proper indexes for performance
6. ✅ Scalable to any group size (2, 3, 4, 10+ people)

**Quick Reference:**
```typescript
// Groups - supports 2+ people
interface Group {
  id: string;
  name: string;                    // "Kim & Ray's Home", "3 Roommates"
  type: 'couple' | 'roommates' | 'friends' | 'family' | 'other';
  settings: { currency: string; splitDefault: string; };
  stats: { memberCount: number; totalExpenses: number; };
}

// GroupMembers - many-to-many relationship
interface GroupMember {
  id: string;
  groupId: string;
  userId: string;
  role: 'owner' | 'admin' | 'member';
  status: 'active' | 'invited' | 'left';
}

// Expenses - flexible splitting
interface Expense {
  id: string;
  type: 'shared' | 'personal';
  groupId?: string;
  amount: number;                  // In cents
  splitType: 'equal' | 'percentage' | 'custom' | 'amount';
  splitData?: { [userId: string]: number };
  paidBy: string;
}
```

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Firebase Security Rules
```javascript

rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Users can only read/write their own data
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    
    // Couple members can access couple data
    match /couples/{coupleId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && 
        (get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.coupleId == coupleId);
    }
    
    // Expenses - users can only access their own or shared expenses
    match /expenses/{expenseId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null && 
        (resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid || 
         resource.data.coupleId == get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.coupleId);
      allow create: if request.auth != null;
      allow update, delete: if request.auth != null && resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
    }
  }
}
```
